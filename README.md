<h2> How to contribute.</h2>
You will need to use Visual Studio 2017 (updated to the latest version prefered) and the Windows 10 Build 16299 SDK. Simply clone the repo to get started.
<p>Create a new branch at first and then make the changes you want, next, open a pull request so that we can discuss those changes and accept them, at last we will merge that branch with the _master branch 🙏</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading through these sets of articles: <a href="https://guides.github.com">GitHub guides</a></p>
